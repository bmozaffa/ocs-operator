# The OCS Meta Operator

This is the primary operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (OCS). It
is a "meta" operator, meaning it serves to facilitate the other operators in
OCS by performing administrative tasks outside their scope as well as
watching and configuring their CustomResources (CRs).

## Build

The operator is based on the [Operator
SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). In order to build the
operator, you first need to install the SDK. [Instructions are
here.](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#quick-start)

Once the SDK is installed, the operator can be built via:

```bash
$ dep ensure --vendor-only

$ operator-sdk build quay.io/openshift/ocs-operator
```
